# Gemini Chatbot

Gemini Chatbot is a simple Python-based chatbot that interacts with users using the Gemini API from Google's GenerativeAI. It allows users to have a conversation with the chatbot and receive responses generated by the Gemini model.

## Gemini API Key Setup Guide

Welcome to the Gemini API Key Setup Guide! This document will walk you through the process of obtaining API keys from Gemini, a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform, so you can integrate their API into your applications or trading bots.

### Step 1: Sign in to your Gemini Account

If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to sign up for one on the [Google Gemini ai dev website](https://ai.google.dev/). Once you've signed up, log in to your account.

### Step 2: Navigate to API Settings

Once logged in, navigate to the "API Settings" section of your account. You can usually find this in the account settings or profile menu.

### Step 3: Generate New API Key

In the API Settings section, you'll see options to create a new API key. Click on the "Generate a new API key" button to start the process.

### Step 4: Configure API Key Settings

Gemini will prompt you to configure your API key settings. You may need to specify permissions for the key, such as trading, view-only, or withdrawal permissions. Make sure to choose the appropriate permissions based on your intended use case.

### Step 5: API Key Confirmation

After configuring the settings, Gemini will provide you with your API key and API secret. These are sensitive pieces of information, so make sure to keep them secure and never share them publicly.

### Step 6: Test API Key

Before integrating the API key into your application or bot, it's a good idea to test it. Gemini usually provides a sandbox environment where you can test your API key without risking real funds. Use this sandbox environment to verify that your API key is working as expected.

### Step 7: Integrate API Key into Your Application

Once you've tested your API key successfully, you can integrate it into your application or trading bot. Make sure to follow Gemini's API documentation for details on how to authenticate API requests using your API key and secret.

### Step 8: Monitor and Maintain Your API Key

Regularly monitor your API key usage and activity to ensure that it's being used securely and appropriately. If you suspect any unauthorized access or unusual activity, revoke the API key immediately and generate a new one.


## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
